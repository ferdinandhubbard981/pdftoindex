here is a command to run a docker container:

docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app/content index-generator --input /app/your-input-file.pdf --blacklist /app/your-blacklist.txt--dir content/


write a sh script that takes two inputs, pdf and blacklist

it should also check if these inputs are there and return a help message if they were not provided.
